# Clean Vue + Sanity app

This project is based on the template which includes a Vue app with a [Sanity Studio](https://www.sanity.io/) – an open-source React application that connects to your Sanity project’s hosted dataset. The Studio is configured locally and can then be deployed for content collaboration.
